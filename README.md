# Soccer Game Result Prediction

The idea of this project is to predict who wins the game with half'time as the prediction time point. 
Therefore, this is a multiclass classification problem in which we can have Home win, Away win and Draw as results.
This problem is approached as a time-series problem, meaning that the time of ocurrence of the event is meaningful for our prediction (we forecast the future with past results).
